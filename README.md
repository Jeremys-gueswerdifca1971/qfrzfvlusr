Oh man, just stumbled out of the theater and my head is kinda still spinning. Felt like I was in a circus act myself, dizzy with all these thoughts. The Cleaner — was it a movie or a wild carnival ride? I'm sitting on this cold bench outside now, you know the kind where metal snakes bite your skin, trying to make sense of it all. The crowed was still buzzing, people jostling past me, someone spilled popcorn on my shoe.

Scenes swirling like those cotton candy twirls, that opening shot where the cleaner walks into the room with a mop but the floor was already spotless. He’s got this aura, kinda like a trapeze artist balancing between grace and madness. I could almost smell the bleach over the sweat in the theater. Haha, and that part where the mop becomes like an extension of his arm, like me flinging my limbs about on stage. My back felt like it was going to snap like a dry twig when he leaned back against that cold, brick wall, just gazing. The silence so loud it was screaming. 

> A lady behind me kept coughing, or was it the movie? Felt more like a soundtrack. The cleaner, he had this lady bug on his shoulder, tiny red and black, as if he's the ringleader of a secret bug circus. What’s with the bugs? They were like stars in the background of a night scene. Enough metaphors, I just can't—people were asking if I’ll download the movie, but I think it’s one you kinda have to watch the movie with your whole body, just let it wash over you like waves of custard. 

And why did nobody question the broom handle that kept growing? Like a beanstalk to absurdity. The cleaner seemed to be living in a loop, or maybe it was me, caught in the dizzy mix of echoing cellphones and the sticky floor beneath my feet. Oh, someone's poodle barked right as the lights came on, nearly jumped out of my skin like one of those old-timey clowns from the jack-in-the-boxes.

Spiders or circus clowns... the cleaner danced between them, and there's something there, something... well, whatever. Maybe there’s a lesson, like how every performance has an end but every stage has an audience. Someone asked if they should download it — yeah? Or nah, I’m still cleaning popcorn from my jacket. 

Anyway, some code thing: 

```javascript
function cleanUp() {
  if (dust === dancing) {
     return sweep + unheardCries + //something else
  }
```
Was that from the script or just my brain short-circuiting? Whatever. You get it.
